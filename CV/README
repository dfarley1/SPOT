Before running setup scripts append the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile


# Adds critical dependencies into shell scope
PATH=$PATH:/opt

# Adds openalpr as shell command
PATH=$PATH:/opt/openalpr/src/bin

# Adds necessary libraries into shell scope
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/opencv/release/lib


Make sure to run the script as such:

sudo ./openalpr_setup.sh

Which runs all other necessary setup scripts.
Note to interface the camera with opencv,
you may need to activate a driver with:

sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
